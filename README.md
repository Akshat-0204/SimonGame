As part of my journey to sharpen my front-end development skills, I embarked on a practice project that brought a classic memory game to life: Simon. This project not only honed my technical abilities but also allowed me to showcase my understanding of core web technologies—HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

Project Overview
The Simon game is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors in the correct order as the game progresses. With each level, the sequence becomes longer, challenging the player’s memory and concentration. The goal of this project was to create a fully functional web-based version of the Simon game that is visually appealing, interactive, and responsive.

Technologies Used
HTML: The backbone of the project, HTML was used to structure the game's interface. Elements such as buttons, display panels, and containers were created to give the game its basic layout.

CSS: To ensure the game was visually engaging, I used CSS to style the interface. This included the design of the buttons, the color scheme, and the layout to make the game not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing.

JavaScript: JavaScript powered the game’s logic, managing the game's behavior, generating random sequences, and handling user input. The game’s interactivity and dynamic features were primarily driven by JavaScript.

jQuery: To simplify DOM manipulation and event handling, I integrated jQuery into the project. This allowed for more efficient and readable code, particularly when dealing with animations and user interactions.

Key Features
Random Sequence Generation: The core of the Simon game lies in its ability to generate and display random sequences of colors. I implemented this feature using JavaScript, ensuring that each level introduces a new challenge for the player.

User Interaction: The game detects user input and compares it with the generated sequence. jQuery was instrumental in capturing these events and ensuring that the game responds accordingly—whether that means progressing to the next level or resetting after a mistake.

Level Progression: With each correct sequence, the game advances the player to a new level, increasing the difficulty by adding another color to the sequence. This was achieved by dynamically updating the sequence array and refreshing the display for the next round.

Visual and Audio Feedback: To enhance the user experience, I added both visual (button animations) and audio (sound effects) feedback. This makes the game more engaging and helps players keep track of their progress.
